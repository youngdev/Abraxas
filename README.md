Abraxas
============
A hacking game similar to Introversion Software's Uplink, but with many key changes.
An open-world hacking and internet simulator with an interpreter engine designed to read enhanced ARM assembley. This allows players to design innovative cracks and subsequent patches for security systems created by others.
The result is an internet featuring anarchy you could only dream of. A simulator designed to rebuild the internet and computers as they were meant to be: open and free to all.
