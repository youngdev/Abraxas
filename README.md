Dharmayuddha
============
A hacking game similar to Introversion Software's Uplink, but with many key changes.
An open-world hacking and internet simulator with a fully featured programming language (dubbed FBPL - Full Blown Programming Language) that allows players to design innovative cracks and subsequent patches for security systems created by players.
There will be a number of systems available and two teams to consider, both with their pros and cons:
Black Hats: Freelance hackers with no organization. Bleeding-edge code for the right price.
White Hats: Government employed agents that are supplied free code modules that are near cutting edge, but new advances take a long time to get approved.

Both teams can be joined or left at any time without consequence (from the game framework, at least. I can't say that for your colleagues!)
